You may notice that the code in some of these projects is not particularly great. These are all tutorial projects(for now) so I am making the decision to leave some of these projects as they are for two reasons:
  1. This allows me to see the progression in ability
  2. This allows me to see what changes I would make due to best practices and allows me to solidify my understanding of what it is to code well and 'cleanly'
